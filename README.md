The first one: Predicting the category of trees in national forest parks using the forest cover type dataset. It contains tree observations from four areas in Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. The dataset includes information about tree type, shade cover, distance to nearby landmarks (roads, etc.), soil type, and local topography. In total, there are more than 500,000 measurements. In addition, the tabular data includes a total of 55 columns, of which the first 54 columns are features and the last column is the predicted tree type, including a total of 7 categories.
Second: Texas Holdâ€™em poker Prediction!!! Its goal is to predict the type of hand. The dataset includes more than 1 million instances, each with 10 features. The last column of the table is the predicted hand type, which also has 10 categories
